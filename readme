Desc: Program implements a simple shell in the terminal. 

Welcome to Techshell!

Techshell is a simple shell that is capable of running any linux command in the terminal. 
Commands are run via the execvp() function, so function as they normally would. 
Parent-related commands exit, cd, and pwd are implemented manually. These commands do not have options available, but do function with basic syntax. 

The interface for the command line displays the current working directory in front of the input line. 

There is also support for file redirection. Only file to stdin and stdout to file are supported at the moment, but pipes are in process of being implemented. 

There is also comprehensive syntax checking for input strings! 
If file redirection syntax is misused, then the program will say as such. 
Syntax checking for pipes is implemented, however pipes do not have functionality when used. 

For testing purposes, hello.c and output.txt are provided. 
output.txt currently contains the contents from the command:
wc < hello.c > output.txt
